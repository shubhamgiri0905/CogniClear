## 🛠️ Tech Stack

**Frontend:**
- React (Vite)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- Lucide React (Icons)
- Recharts (Data Visualization)
- Google Generative AI SDK

**Backend:**
- Node.js & Express
- MongoDB (Mongoose)
- JSON Web Token (JWT) Auth

## 📦 Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/CogniClear.git
    cd CogniClear
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory:
    ```env
    PORT=5000
    MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
    JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
    ```

3.  **Setup Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../frontend
    npm install
    ```
    Create a `.env` file in the `frontend` directory:
    ```env
    VITE_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:5000
    VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key
    ```

4.  **Run the App**
    *   **Backend:** `npm start` (inside `backend/`)
    *   **Frontend:** `npm run dev` (inside `frontend/`)

## 💡 How It Works

1.  **Log a Decision**: Describe the situation, your emotions, and the options you are weighing.
2.  **Get Insights**: Gemini analyzes your input to point out biases (like Confirmation Bias or Sunk Cost Fallacy) and suggests questions you hadn't considered.
3.  **Review Simulations**: See "Best Case," "Worst Case," and "Likely" scenarios generated by AI.
4.  **Decide & Track**: Mark your choice. Later, come back to record what actually happened to improve your intuition.
